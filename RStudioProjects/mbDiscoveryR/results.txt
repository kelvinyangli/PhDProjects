known model false prior: 

insurance - iamb is the best across all sample sizes, pcmb becomes competitive to iamb under 10000 sample, mmlcpt is also very close to iamb
but for small samples, pcmb and mmlcpt are not where close to iamb in general performance, although mmlcpt shows superior precision under 
all sample sizes. 


alarm - iamb and mmlcpt are good under small samples; rpdmb and ipcmb are good under medium samples; ipcmb and pcmb are good under large samples; 

known model true prior: 

insurance - among all methods with symmetry check, mmlcpt is always the best across all sample sizes; it has the highest precision almost all time,
 but recall lower recall than iamb; comparing with mml and pcmb, iamb does not converge well when increasing sample size; the symmetry check helps 
mml increase overal perforamnce, however the results don't change for pcmb (maybe due to there is a symmetry check for pc in its algorithm), and 
can even decrease for iamb under large sample, eg under 10000 samples case.  this is because iamb has a high recall but low precision. 

alarm - after applying symmetry check, mmlcpt is always the best across all sample sizes; the precision is always the highest, but recall iamb is 
always the highest; notice that iamb does not converge well when increasing sample size; also notice that pcmb doesn't change much after symmetry
check (maybe due to there is a symmetry check for pc in its algorithm), iamb under large sample decrease accuracy after symmetry check; 

apparently, after using true prior, mmlcpt obtains a higher accuracy, and outperformances other methods, because other methods don't take into
account prior distribution; this is good and bad; good because if prior is available then we could further improve mb discovery accuracy; bad 
because in practice prior doesn't always available. 


artificial model true prior: 

7231 - both iamb and mml do well across all sample sizes; for large sample, all methods converge to the perfect scores. 

34441 - as under small samples in the above case, both iamb and mml do well; but iamb doesn’t do well under large samples, although it occationally
has very high recall rate, but with a low precision rate; pcmb and mml converge well in general. in general, mml does well under all sample sizes 
and has a consistency performance. 

50561 - as in small and medium models, mml and iamb do well under small samples; but iamb doesn't converge well when increasing sample size; 
pcmb and mml converge well and are better under large samples. notice that pcmb has good overall performance, but no high precision nor recall, for
example under 10000 samples, it indicates that pcmb has the similar rate for precision and recall, unlike mml or iamb, which has one score much 
higher than the other.
