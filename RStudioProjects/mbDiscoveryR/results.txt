known model false prior: 

insurance - iamb is the best across all sample sizes, pcmb becomes competitive to iamb under 10000 sample, mmlcpt is also very close to iamb
but for small samples, pcmb and mmlcpt are not where close to iamb in general performance, although mmlcpt shows superior precision under 
all sample sizes. 


alarm - iamb and mmlcpt are good under small samples; rpdmb and ipcmb are good under medium samples; ipcmb and pcmb are good under large samples; 

known model true prior: 

asia - 

insurance - 

alarm - after applying symmetry check, mmlcpt is always the best across all sample sizes; the precision is always the highest, but recall iamb is 
always the highest; notice that iamb does not converge well when increasing sample size; also notice that pcmb doesn't change much after symmetry
check (maybe due to there is a symmetry check for pc in its algorithm), iamb under large sample decrease accuracy after symmetry check; 

apparently, after using true prior, mmlcpt obtains a higher accuracy, and outperformances other methods, because other methods don't take into
account prior distribution; this is good and bad; good because if prior is available then we could further improve mb discovery accuracy; bad 
because in practice prior doesn't always available.
