\title{A function to calculate the mml of cpt model}
\usage{
mml_cpt(indexListPerNodePerValue, arities, sampleSize, parentsIndices,
  targetIndex, logFactorialSheet, base = exp(1))
}
\arguments{
\item{indexListPerNodePerValue}{A list of stored indices for each value of each node. It is obtained 
by the function count_occurance().}

\item{arities}{A vector of varaible arities.}

\item{sampleSize}{Sample size of the given data set.}

\item{parentsIndices}{Indices of parents nodes.}

\item{targetIndex}{Index of the target node.}

\item{logFactorialSheet}{A pre-saved log factorial sheet for non-negative integers <= 10000.}

\item{base}{The base of the logarithm.}
}
\description{
There is no difference between mml_cpt_fast() and mml_cpt(), other than the speed difference.
